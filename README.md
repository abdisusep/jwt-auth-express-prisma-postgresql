# jwt-auth-express-prisma-postgresql
Implementing JWT Authentication with Express.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

Key Features:
1. **Organized Project Structure**: The project is configured with a well-organized structure, making it easy to navigate and understand different parts of the application.
2. **Express.js Server**: The backend server is developed using Express.js, a lightweight and fast Node.js framework, to handle HTTP requests from clients.
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: User information and JWT tokens are stored and managed using PostgreSQL, a robust and reliable relational database system.
4. **User Authentication**: Implementation of API endpoints for user registration and secure login processes. User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
5. **JSON Web Token Usage**: Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT token used to identify and authenticate the user on subsequent requests.
6. **JWT Middleware**: Middleware is included to verify JWT tokens on every request requiring authentication, ensuring that only valid users can access protected resources.
7. **Error Handling and Security**: Good error management techniques and security practices are implemented in this project to maintain reliability and security of the application.
